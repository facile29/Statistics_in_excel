Learning statistics using Excel is a good approach, especially as a beginner. Excel provides a user-friendly interface and powerful tools for data analysis, which can help you grasp statistical concepts more easily. The benefits for statistical learning is: Built- in functions, Visualizations, Data- manipulation, etc.
In this repository, I have shared my journey in learning statistics:

1. Categorical Data: Understanding how to analyze and visualize categorical data helps you make sense of data that can be divided into distinct groups.

2. Numerical Data: Working with numerical data allows you to perform various statistical analyses and understand distributions.

3. Scatter Plots: These are excellent for exploring relationships between two numerical variables, helping you identify trends, correlations, and outliers.

4. Cross Plots: Also useful for examining relationships, particularly in multi-variable datasets, allowing you to compare how different groups interact.

5. Histograms: These give insights into the distribution of numerical data, helping you understand frequency and the shape of the data.

6. Measures of Central Tendency: Learning about mean, median, and mode helps summarize data and understand where most values lie.
